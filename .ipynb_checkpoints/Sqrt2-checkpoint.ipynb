    "To calculate the square root of a number in python you need to use the power operator, x ** y, where x is the number you would like to get the square root of and y is 0.5. This is based on the mathmatical property of $\\sqrt{x}$ = $x^{\\frac{1}{2}}$, i.e. the square root of a number is equal to that number to the power of ${\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a common example, we know that $\\sqrt{4} = 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely $2^{2} = 4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now raise both to the half power.\n",
    "\n",
    "$2^{2^\\frac{1}{2}} = 4^{\\frac{1}{2}}$\n",

    "When raising a power to another power you multiply them.\n",
    "\n",
    "$2^{2\\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^1 = 2$\n",

    "So from this we can infer that $2 = 4^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ and subsequently $\\sqrt{4} = 4^{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n",

    "The following function will calculate the square root of 2 and given that the 2 is not a perfect square it will return an irrational number, one that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. As such the function will return the square root of 2 to 100 places. "
